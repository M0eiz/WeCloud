            <h2><b>Reflection : What I learned from Chapter 6</b></h2><br>Microservices architecture is like building software with small, independent blocksâ€”each doing one job (like login, payments, or delivery tracking). Instead of one big, hard-to-change system, microservices make updates easier, improve reliability, and allow scaling only the parts that need it. They communicate through messages (like texts or calls) and handle failures smartly (like a circuit breaker stopping bad requests). Real-world apps like Netflix use this to stay fast and resilient. Overall, microservices make software flexible, efficient, and easier to manage!
