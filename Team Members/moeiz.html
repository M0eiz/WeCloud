            <h2>Building the repo</h2><br> I learned about how to create repos on github and how to work with teams.
        </li>
        <li class="profspeak">What was the biggest difficulty you've experienced in working with your team?</li>
        <li>
            <h2>CLI Learns</h2><br>I learned how to make new files, folders open vs code and push and pull things
            to/from github.
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">How is working with team members using mainly windows when you use MacOS? Any difficulties
            caused by that?<br>I haven't faced many major issues working with team members using Windows while I use macOS. However, one challenge has been that macOS has different terminal commands compared to Windows, which sometimes made certain tasks a bit tricky. Despite that, the overall experience has been smooth, and most of the differences were manageable.</li>

            <h2><b>Reflection : What I learned from Chapter 6</b></h2><br>Microservices architecture is like building software with small, independent blocksâ€”each doing one job (like login, payments, or delivery tracking). Instead of one big, hard-to-change system, microservices make updates easier, improve reliability, and allow scaling only the parts that need it. They communicate through messages (like texts or calls) and handle failures smartly (like a circuit breaker stopping bad requests). Real-world apps like Netflix use this to stay fast and resilient. Overall, microservices make software flexible, efficient, and easier to manage!
