            <h2>Building the repo</h2><br>I learned a lot about repos like how to commit and push files from VS code<br>
        <li class="profspeak">Have you practiced doing it in terminal outside of VS code? It is good to be well-versed
            in both.</li>

            <h2>What did I learn from chapter 6?</h2><br>In Chapter 6, I learned that microservices are small, self-contained services that work together to build applications. 
            Each service has a specific role and can run independently, which makes systems easier to scale and maintain. 
            They donâ€™t store internal state, making them flexible and easier to move across servers. 
            I found it interesting how they use lightweight communication methods like REST and JSON. Microservices can be built using different languages and tools, giving developers more freedom. 
            The chapter also highlighted how they improve deployment through automation and continuous updates. 
            I learned that designing them well requires careful planning, especially around data sharing and service coordination. Overall, microservices make software more adaptable, reliable, and easier to update.
