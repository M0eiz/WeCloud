            <h2>Building the repo</h2><br>I learned a lot about repos like how to commit and push files from VS code<br>
        <li class="profspeak">Have you practiced doing it in terminal outside of VS code? It is good to be well-versed
            in both.<br>Yes, I have practiced using the terminal in Windows as well as Git Bash. From now on, I am committing to permanently rely on the terminal, as VS Code occasionally presents issues that I can't resolve within its own console but can fix using the terminal.</li>

            <h2>CLI Learns</h2><br>I learned how to navigte, build, and manipulate files using only the CLI.
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">What was the most uesful command that you learned? <br>The most useful commands I learned are git clone, git commit, git push, and git pull—they form the core of collaborating on GitHub. I also found git log helpful to view commit history and track changes. Recently, I discovered git stash, which lets me save uncommitted changes temporarily without losing work. These commands really boosted my workflow efficiency.</li>

            <h2>What did I learn from chapter 6?</h2><br>In Chapter 6, I learned that microservices are small, self-contained services that work together to build applications. 
            Each service has a specific role and can run independently, which makes systems easier to scale and maintain. 
            They don’t store internal state, making them flexible and easier to move across servers. 
            I found it interesting how they use lightweight communication methods like REST and JSON. Microservices can be built using different languages and tools, giving developers more freedom. 
            The chapter also highlighted how they improve deployment through automation and continuous updates. 
            I learned that designing them well requires careful planning, especially around data sharing and service coordination. Overall, microservices make software more adaptable, reliable, and easier to update.
