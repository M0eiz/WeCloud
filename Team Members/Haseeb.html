        <li>
            <h2><span class="icon">üìÅ</span>Building the Repo</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about repos like how to commit and push files from VS Code.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p><strong>Professor's Question: Have you practiced doing it in terminal outside of VS Code? It is good to be well-versed in both.</strong></p>
            <p>My Answer to that: Yes, I have practiced using the terminal in Windows as well as Git Bash. From now on, I am committing to permanently rely on the terminal, as VS Code occasionally presents issues that I can't resolve within its own console but can fix using the terminal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2><span class="icon">üíª</span>CLI Learns</h2>
            <p>I learned how to navigate, build, and manipulate files using only the CLI.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p><strong>Professor's Question: What was the most useful command that you learned?</strong></p>
            <p>My Answer to that: The most useful commands I learned are <code>git clone</code>, <code>git commit</code>, <code>git push</code>, and <code>git pull</code>, they form the core of collaborating on GitHub. I also found <code>git log</code> helpful to view commit history and track changes. Recently, I discovered <code>git stash</code>, which lets me save uncommitted changes temporarily without losing work. These commands really boosted my workflow efficiency.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2><span class="icon">üìö</span>What Did I Learn from Chapter 6?</h2>
            <p>In Chapter 6, I learned that microservices are small, self-contained services that work together to build applications. Each service has a specific role and can run independently, which makes systems easier to scale and maintain. They don‚Äôt store internal state, making them flexible and easier to move across servers.</p>
            <p>I found it interesting how they use lightweight communication methods like REST and JSON. Microservices can be built using different languages and tools, giving developers more freedom. The chapter also highlighted how they improve deployment through automation and continuous updates. Designing them well requires careful planning, especially around data sharing and service coordination. Overall, microservices make software more adaptable, reliable, and easier to update.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>Insights from Today‚Äôs Session: Empirical Software Design ‚Äì When and Why</h2>
            <p>
                Watching <em>Empirical Software Design ‚Äì When and Why</em> completely changed how I think about writing and maintaining software.
                I used to think you had to get the design perfect upfront, but Kent Beck showed that it‚Äôs more about evolving the design
                as the system grows and as you learn.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                One point that really stood out was how most of the money in software isn‚Äôt spent building it‚Äîit‚Äôs spent maintaining it.
                That made me realize that writing clean, adaptable code is one of the most valuable things you can do for a project long-term.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                He also talked about cohesion and collision, and how important it is to keep related code together while avoiding mixing
                unrelated parts. These ideas helped me understand why some code feels clean and some just feels chaotic.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Another big takeaway was the value of small, early efforts to tidy code. Planning and tidying early‚Äîeven if the program
                is still small‚Äîcan save a lot of time later. It‚Äôs not just about neatness, but about building a solid foundation that
                can grow without collapsing under its own weight.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                He tied a lot of this into <em>Extreme Programming</em>, where the idea is to work in small steps, gather feedback,
                and constantly adjust. That made design feel much more flexible and less intimidating.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                Finally, I found it really interesting how he mentioned <em>AI</em>. As tools like AI start helping us write code,
                they‚Äôll work better with clear, well-structured codebases. So in a way, tidying code helps both people and machines
                understand what‚Äôs going on.
              </p>
            
              <p>
                In the end, the video helped me realize that software design isn‚Äôt just a technical task‚Äîit‚Äôs a process of learning,
                improving, and adapting over time.
