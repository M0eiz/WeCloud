    <h1>Prasiddhaâ€™s Weekly Reflection ðŸŒŸ</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>Creating and Managing the Repository</h2>
            <p>This week, I learned a lot about version control systems, especially how Git helps in managing code efficiently. I also became more comfortable with using the command line interface (CLI) to initialize and manage my repository.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> What happened when your repo changed name? Did it affect the URL? What about the folder names on your local copies?</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> When I changed the repository name on GitHub, the remote URL also changed. This broke the connection between my local repo and the GitHub repo until I updated the remote URL using <code>git remote set-url origin [new-URL]</code>. However, the local folder name remained the same unless I renamed it manually.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Exploring the Command Line</h2>
            <p>I practiced pushing and pulling files using the CLI. It gave me a better understanding of how changes are tracked and shared. Itâ€™s a fast and powerful way to interact with Git.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p><strong>Question:</strong> Have you been using the VS Code terminal, Windows terminal, or something else? Try a different approach and write back here how it goes.</p>
            <p><strong>Answer:</strong> Iâ€™ve mostly been using the VS Code terminal because itâ€™s convenient and integrated right into my code editor. I did try the Windows Terminal as well, and I liked how customizable it is. It feels faster and cleaner when running multiple CLI sessions side-by-side.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Key Takeaways from Chapter 6</h2>
            <p>This chapter introduced me to the concept of microservices â€” breaking down applications into smaller, independent services. Itâ€™s a great approach for building scalable and maintainable systems.</p>
        </li>
