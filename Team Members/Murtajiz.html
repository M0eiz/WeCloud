            <h2>Building the Repo</h2>
            <p>I learned a lot about repos like how to commit files and folders.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            What happened when your repo changed name? Did it affect the URL? What about the folder names on your local copies?
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>GitHub Learns</h2>
            <p>The URL does change, but GitHub automatically redirects the old URL to the new one, so existing clones and links still work.
                Local folder names do not change automatically. If you want the local folder to reflect the new repo name, you'll have to manually rename it.
            </p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            Have you run into any difficulties with the different operating systems represented by your team members?
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>No, I did not face any difficulty.</p>
        </li>

            <h2>What Did I Learn from Chapter 6</h2>
            <p>Chapter 6 explains the microservices architecture, emphasizing the design of small, independent, stateless services that communicate via lightweight protocols.
                It highlights key characteristics like loose coupling, high cohesion, and independent deployment. The chapter also covers service decomposition, communication patterns,
                data management, and consistency challenges. It stresses the importance of automation in continuous deployment and introduces concepts like circuit breakers for fault tolerance
                and RESTful principles for service interaction. Overall, it advocates for microservices to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-based systems.

            <h2>Kent Beck's Talk</h2>
            <p>Kent Beck’s *Tidy First* completely reshaped how I approach writing and maintaining code. Rather than jumping straight into new features, he emphasizes the value of first taking a 
               moment to clean up—making small, low-risk improvements that enhance structure and clarity without changing how the code behaves. It’s a simple concept, but surprisingly powerful.

               What really resonated with me was the idea that better code design doesn’t require a massive refactor. Tidying can—and should—be a regular practice, keeping the codebase healthier 
               and more manageable over time. Beck also highlights the importance of owning code quality from the start, which can prevent bigger issues down the road. 
                
               Tidy First felt less like a technical strategy and more like a mindset shift—one that encourages treating code with respect and designing with intention before charging ahead. It’s a habit I definitely want to adopt moving forward.</p>
