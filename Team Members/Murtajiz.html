            <h2>What Did I learn from Chapter 6</h2>
            <br>Chapter 6 explains the microservices architecture, emphasizing the design of small, independent, stateless 
                services that communicate via lightweight protocols. It highlights key characteristics like loose coupling, 
                high cohesion, and independent deployment. The chapter also covers service decomposition, communication patterns, 
                data management, and consistency challenges. It stresses the importance of automation in continuous deployment and 
                introduces concepts like circuit breakers for fault tolerance and RESTful principles for service interaction. 
                Overall, it advocates for microservices to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-based systems.
