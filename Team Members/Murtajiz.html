            <h2>Github learns Learns</h2><br>The URL does change, but GitHub automatically redirects the old URL 
            to the new one, so existing clones and links still work.Local folder names do not change automatically. 
            If you want the local folder to reflect the new repo name, you'll have to manually rename it.

            <h2>What Did I learn from Chapter 6</h2>
            <br>Chapter 6 explains the microservices architecture, emphasizing the design of small, independent, stateless
                services that communicate via lightweight protocols. It highlights key characteristics like loose coupling, 
                high cohesion, and independent deployment. The chapter also covers service decomposition, communication patterns, 
                data management, and consistency challenges. It stresses the importance of automation in continuous deployment and 
                introduces concepts like circuit breakers for fault tolerance and RESTful principles for service interaction. 
                Overall, it advocates for microservices to build scalable, resilient, and maintainable cloud-based systems.
