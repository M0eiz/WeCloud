            <h2>Chapter :6 - Microservices Architecture</h2><br>I learned how microservices allow applications to be built as a collection of small,
             independent services. This approach makes it easier to scale, update, and manage each part of an application. 

             I also understood the importance of tools like Docker and Kubernetes in deploying and managing these services efficiently. 
             I learned the benefits of independent deployment, scalability, and flexibility, as well as the challenges like managing complexity and ensuring communication between services. 
             Overall, it gave me a clear picture of why microservices are important in modern software development.
