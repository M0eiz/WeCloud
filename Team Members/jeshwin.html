    <h1>Jeshwin's Weekly Reflections üåü</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            <h2>GitHub & Repos</h2>
            <p>I explored how Git and GitHub help manage source code. I learned how to commit changes, push to a repository, and track version history using VS Code. It‚Äôs a game-changer for team collaboration and code backup.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p>What's loading? Clarify what ‚Äúrepo loading‚Ä¶‚Äù really means ? - I wrote ‚Äúrepo loading‚Ä¶‚Äù to indicate that I was in the process of creating my GitHub repository and setting things up, like initializing it, committing files, and getting it ready for version control.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>CLI Learns</h2>
            <p>The command-line interface was initially intimidating, but I learned how to navigate folders, create files, and execute scripts efficiently. The speed and control it offers are unmatched.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="profspeak">
            <p>What CLI command or feature did you find most useful? - One of the most useful CLI commands I learned is git status. It gives a clear view of what's happening in the repository ‚Äî which files are staged, which ones are modified, and what‚Äôs ready to be committed. It helped me stay organized and confident while working in the terminal.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <h2>Microservices Architecture (Chapter 6)</h2>
            <p>Microservices allow software to be built as a set of small, independent components. Each service handles one function and can be deployed separately. I found it useful for scalability and fault isolation. If one service fails, others keep working. But it also comes with challenges like data consistency and service coordination.</p>
