# WeCloud Quality Attribute Analysis Document

## Introduction
WeCloud is a cross-platform cloud backup system designed to simplify secure file storage, synchronization, and recovery for users across Windows, macOS, Linux, and iOS. Given its scope and scale, the system's ability to maintain specific quality attributes—such as security, performance, scalability, reliability, usability, and maintainability—is critical. This document analyzes how WeCloud's architecture and layered design support these key quality attributes.


## Performance
### Definition: 
Performance refers to the system's ability to respond quickly and efficiently to user requests.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
A key feature of WeCloud is near real-time file syncing across devices. Fast synchronization ensures user trust and a smooth experience.

### Architectural Support:
- The use of Kubernetes in the Infrastructure Layer enables horizontal scaling and load balancing, helping maintain fast response times under load.
- The Presentation Layer is built on React/Next.js, ensuring a lightweight and fast UI.
- Sync operations handled in the Real-Time Sync Layer are optimized for minimal latency, with AI-powered notifications ensuring up-to-date user feedback.
- Use of client-side controllers offloads processing from the backend, improving perceived speed.
- Efficient data models and indexed queries in PostgreSQL and MongoDB enhance retrieval speeds.

### Trade-offs: 
Performance optimizations, such as rapid sync under 5s, may require limiting some deep encryption checks to maintain speed. Performance may compete with security layers (e.g., encryption, AI scans) and must be optimized accordingly.



## Security
### Definition: 
Protection of data and system from unauthorized access and vulnerabilities.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
As a cloud storage and backup platform, WeCloud must ensure the safety of user data at rest and in transit.

### Architectural Support:
- The Authentication and Authorization layer uses OAuth 2.0 and Firebase Auth to ensure secure identity verification.
- The Security & AI Monitoring Service detects anomalies, enforces access control, and logs activities for auditing.
- The End-to-End Encryption module ensures confidentiality during file transfers.
- Cloud Storage is integrated with secure API access and multi-region replication to prevent data loss and unauthorized access.

### Trade-offs: 
Strong encryption and security monitoring may slightly impact sync performance but are essential to user trust.



## Scalability
### Definition: 
Ability of the system to handle increased workload without performance degradation.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
With potential for a large user base and frequent file operations, scalability is critical.

### Architectural Support:
- The Infrastructure Layer uses Kubernetes, which enables auto-scaling of services.
- The CI/CD pipeline automates deployment across environments, allowing rapid scaling.
- In the Data Access Layer, using both PostgreSQL and MongoDB allows the system to scale for structured and unstructured data respectively.
- Stateless microservices in layers like File Management Service and User Management Service simplify scaling.

### Trade-offs: 
Maintaining consistency across replicated services and databases introduces complexity.



## Availability
### Definition: 
The system's ability to be operational and accessible when needed.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
Users expect continuous access to their files and backups without downtime.

### Architectural Support:
- The use of Cloud Storage with multi-region replication ensures files are accessible even in case of regional failure.
- The CI/CD pipeline supports rapid recovery through automated deployment and rollback.
- Monitoring via the Logging & Monitoring component enables proactive detection of failures.

### Trade-offs: 
High availability requires redundancy, which increases resource usage and cost.



## Reliability
### Definition: 
The system’s ability to function correctly and consistently over time.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
Users depend on the platform for critical backups and file recovery, demanding minimal downtime.

### Architectural Support:
- Multi-region support and replication in Cloud Storage mitigate failure risks.
- Monitoring and Logging services track system health, enabling fast recovery from issues.
- The use of CI/CD enables fast bug fixes and updates without disrupting service.



## Maintainability
### Definition: 
Ease with which the system can be updated, debugged, and enhanced.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
As a continuously evolving platform, maintainability ensures long-term sustainability.

### Architectural Support:
- The system follows a layered architecture (presentation, business, data, infrastructure), encouraging modular updates.
- Logging & Monitoring provides developers with real-time insights for issue tracking.
- The CI/CD pipeline supports fast and safe deployment of changes.
- Use of modern technologies like Sequelize ORM, containerization, and microservices enhances developer efficiency.

### Trade-offs: 
Maintainability may slightly reduce raw performance due to extra abstraction layers.



## Modularity
### Definition: 
Designing a system in independent parts that can be developed, updated, or replaced separately.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
Modularity supports parallel development, simplified debugging, and faster integration.

### Architectural Support:
- Independent services like File Management, Security Monitoring, and Backup & Sync are loosely coupled and operate via APIs.
- The Business Layer manages orchestration logic without embedding it into individual services.

### Trade-offs: 
Inter-service communication over APIs can introduce slight overhead.



## Usability
### Definition: 
Ease with which users can interact with the system and perform desired tasks.

### Relevance to WeCloud: 
A smooth, intuitive UI increases user satisfaction and adoption.

### Architectural Support:
- The User Interface layer includes well-separated components like dashboard, file explorer, and settings.
- The Presentation Layer includes clearly defined views and client-side controllers to improve user experience.
- Real-Time Notifications and AI-powered alerts improve transparency for users.
- Controllers simplify complex interactions (e.g., file sharing, backup status).
- Integration with the Sync Layer ensures that users always see up-to-date data.

### Trade-offs: 
Extra effort is required in frontend optimization and testing to maintain high usability.


## Trade-Offs and Prioritization
WeCloud carefully balances performance and security. While encryption and anomaly detection may slightly impact sync speed, they are necessary to meet user expectations around data safety. Scalability via Kubernetes and the CI/CD pipeline is prioritized to ensure smooth onboarding of new users and deployments. Usability and maintainability are achieved through modular design and layered architecture.

## Conclusion
The WeCloud architecture demonstrates clear support for critical quality attributes through thoughtful design decisions, such as layered separation, modern cloud infrastructure, and security-first principles. The diagrams produced during the project serve as strong visual justification for how each quality goal is achieved in practice.
